- _SQLAlchemy🛢️:_ This Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool simplifies our database interactions by allowing us to manipulate the database using Python objects rather than raw SQL queries. This speeds up development and reduces errors.

- _MySQL 🏠:_ We use MySQL for structured data storage. It manages vast amounts of user data, energy metrics, and transactions, ensuring reliable and secure data storage.

### **Data Visualization & Real-Time Trends:**
- _Charts.js 📊:_ This JavaScript library powers our real-time energy trend visualizations, offering interactive charts that allow users to track and analyze their energy consumption, usage patterns, and pricing trends easily.

- _Tableau 📈:_ For advanced data analysis, especially in industrial and power plant dashboards, we use Tableau. It helps visualize large datasets, offering detailed insights into energy metrics across various sectors.

### **Chatbot & Interaction:**

- _RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) 🤖_: Our chatbot utilizes RAG to enhance user interactions. It retrieves relevant information and generates personalized responses based on user queries, ensuring accurate and context-sensitive answers.

- _LLM (Large Language Models) 🧠:_ The chatbot is built using an advanced LLM (e.g., LLaMA 3), which powers the FAQ and Summary functionalities. Users can read blog posts with auto-generated Summaries or explore frequently asked questions (FAQs) for quick insights into energy-related topics.

- _User Interface (UI) 🎨:_ The chatbot’s user interface has been developed using Chainlit for a seamless and intuitive user experience.
